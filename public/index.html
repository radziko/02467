            The data is primarily collected from the spotify and genius apis.
            It takes its fundament in a ranked list of songs which have spend the most time on the U.S. weekly charts in the period 2013-2023.
            By taking the set of artists who made these songs, we can find the <strong>artists of the top charts</strong>. For this group of artists who have rocked the charts at least once, their features, genres and lyrics are collected.

        <h3>Who loves a feature?</h3>
        <p>The artists with the most features are all male. The features count collaborations going both ways, hence both being feature on songs and having features.
            An artist who likes including other artists and being included in their songs and is <strong>Future</strong>, with impressive <strong>603</strong> collaborations with the top charts artists. 
            It seems that all the artists are within the same genres, which is <strong>hip hop</strong> and <strong>rap</strong>. 
            Maybe it is because these genres are more open to collaborations than other genres, or maybe it is because the top charts artists are more productive.
            Relevant questions are: 
            <ul>
                <li>Are collaborations happening across genres?</li>
                <li>What characterizes a certain genre with regards to collaborations and use of lyrics?</li>
              </ul>  
            <br>

            Let's look further into this!
            First each artist has multiple genres, but is assigned one top genre, these includes everything from pop, rap, country to korean-ost, torch and bass.

        <h2>Network</h2>
        <p>By treating the artists as nodes and the amount of collaborations as edges with weights, it is possible to form a network of artists.
<br> 
The networks nodes are colored after their top genre. 
The <strong>modularity</strong> index of a network measures how well the groups (colors) of the networks are partitioning the network in terms of collaborations between artists.

        <h2>Top Genres</h2>
        <p>Let's focus on the 5 largest genres!

<br>
<br>

The rap and hip-hop genre are the genre with the most collaborations on average per artist. The average artist has about <strong>90</strong> collaborations in this genre.
On the contrary, the average artist has only <strong>7</strong> collaboration in the rock genre. 
Pop and country are close to the mean of <strong>40</strong> collaborations per artist.

When hearing a rap or hip-hop song, it is not uncommon to hear multiple artists on the same song, which is significantly less common in rock songs.

<br>
<br>

Generally, there is a large difference between the genres in terms of the number of collaborations per artist.
