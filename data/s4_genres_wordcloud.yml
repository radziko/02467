title : "Lyrics Analysis"
content: These are wordclouds based on the TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) scores grouped by genre, for lyrics in the top 3 most popular songs from each of the artist. Note that there are explicit words contained in the different genres. Hip-hop, rap and trap all follow very similar themes, including some explicit one. Pop contains a lot of spanish words, as Spanish speaking musicians are very well represented in the American top-charts, and they're almost all pop-musicians. Country is very country-esque, because the themes are very well-connected. Whiskey & beer, travel/driving and the southern U.S states all prevail. The rest of the genres are a bit harder to analyse, and a lot of them contain names of either songs or artists. <br> Generally, the genres were quite different, with the exception of the rap-esque genres.
