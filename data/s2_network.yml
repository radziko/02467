  By treating the artists as nodes and the amount of collaborations as edges with weights, it is possible to form a network of artists.
  <br> 
  The networks nodes are colored after their top genre. 
  The <strong>modularity</strong> index of a network measures how well the groups (colors) of the networks are partitioning the network in terms of collaborations between artists. 
  The network contains <strong> 1147 </strong> nodes, and <strong> 7156</strong> edges.
  The network has a modularity of <strong> 0.204</strong> for the original partioning.
  This can be seen on the left-most network.

  We found that this modularity was significantly different from a random, double-edge-swapped network.

  Afterwards, we computed a new Louvain partitioning. This can be seen in the right-most graph. This is the best partitioning possible for the graph.
  This achieved a modularity of <strong>0.560</strong>.
  Since the Louvain partition has 262 groups and there are 101, it seems like there exists groups who are more likely to collaborate within the genres. Hence, the genres are not explaining everything in terms of collaborations, since these also happen across genres.
